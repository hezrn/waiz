# Firebase Conversations Quick Reference

## 📦 What Changed

### New Feature: Conversation-Based Messaging
Instead of direct `messages/` collection, now using organized conversations:

```
OLD: messages/{messageId}
NEW: conversations/{conversationId}/messages/{messageId}
     + Better organization
     + Cleaner metadata
     + Easier to find conversation threads
```

| **Message Structure** | Simple flat list | Organized by conversation |
| **Auto-Scroll** | Manual | Automatic to latest |

## 🔧 Core Functions

### Marketplace (Contact Button)
```typescript
const handleContact = async () => {
  // Create or get conversation
  const convId = await getOrCreateConversation(currentUserId, sellerId);
  
  // Get seller name
  const sellerName = await fetchUserNameFromDB(sellerId);
  
  // Navigate to messages with conversation
  navigate(`/messages?conversationId=${convId}`);
};
```

### Messages Page (Real-Time)
```typescript
// Listen to all user conversations
const conversationsRef = ref(database, "conversations");
onValue(conversationsRef, (snapshot) => {
  // Filter to current user, build list
  setAllConversations(...);
});

// Listen to selected conversation messages
const messagesRef = ref(database, `conversations/${convId}/messages`);
onValue(messagesRef, (snapshot) => {
  // Auto-scroll, mark as read
  setConversationMessages(...);
});
```

- [ ] Messages page loads conversation list
- [ ] Conversation names are actual user names (not "Unknown")
- [ ] Clicking conversation opens chat thread
- [ ] Sending message shows it immediately
- [ ] No console errors (F12)
- [ ] Auto-scroll works when new message arrives
- [ ] "Unknown" doesn't appear anywhere in UI

## 🐛 Quick Troubleshooting

### No Conversations Showing
```
✓ Check: User logged in?
✓ Check: Have any Contact button clicks worked?
✓ Check: Firebase structure: go to Realtime Database → conversations
✓ Check: Console for errors
```

### "Unknown" Still Showing
```
✓ Check: User profile exists in Firebase?
✓ Check: User has 'name' field populated?
✓ Fallback: Should show user ID if name missing
```

### Contact Button Disabled
```
✓ Check: Are you a Junkshop user?
✓ Check: Is this someone else's item?
✓ Check: Internet connection?
```

### Messages Not Sending
```
✓ Check: Firebase connected? (see other messages?)
✓ Check: User logged in?
✓ Check: Conversation exists? (check Firebase)
✓ Check: No network errors? (DevTools Network tab)
```

### Conversation Object
```json
{
  "id": "conv_user_123_user_456",
  "participants": ["user_123", "user_456"],
  "participantNames": {
    "user_123": "John Doe",
    "user_456": "Jane Smith"
  },
  "createdAt": "2025-04-09T10:00:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-04-09T10:05:00Z",
  "messages": {
    "msg_1234567890_abc": { ... }
  }
}
```

### Message Object
```json
{
  "id": "msg_1234567890_abc",
  "senderId": "user_123",
  "senderName": "John Doe",
  "receiverId": "user_456",
  "receiverName": "Jane Smith",
  "content": "Hello! Are you interested?",
  "read": false,
  "timestamp": "2025-04-09T10:03:00Z"
}
```

## 🧪 Manual Testing

### Test 1: Basic Contact Flow
1. Open app in two browsers
2. Browser A: Logged as Household (seller, item owner)
3. Browser B: Logged as Junkshop (buyer)
4. Browser B: Go to marketplace
5. Browser B: Click Contact on Household's item
6. Browser B: Should see conversation opened
7. Browser B: Should see Household's name (not "Unknown")
8. Browser B: Send message
9. Browser B: Should see message immediately
10. Browser A: Should see message in Messages tab

### Test 2: Repeated Contact
1. Contact same person twice
2. Should show same conversation (not duplicated)
3. Previous messages should be visible

### Test 3: Auto-Scroll
1. Open conversation
2. Send message in another browser
3. Should auto-scroll to show new message

## 📞 Common Questions

**Q: Will my old messages be lost?**
A: No, old `messages/` collection still exists. Old messages still work if you navigate directly. New conversations use the organized structure.

**Q: Why are names stored in conversations?**
A: Faster retrieval and offline support. Names are cached when conversation created.

**Q: What if user changes their name?**
A: Conversation stores snapshot at creation time. New conversations will have updated name.

**Q: Can I delete conversations?**
A: Not implemented yet, but structure supports it. Contact developer if needed.

**Q: Why conversation ID format?**
A: Ensures same ID regardless of who initiates. `conv_123_456` and `conv_456_123` both reference same conversation.

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test the implementation** using the manual testing steps above
2. **Monitor the console** (F12) for any errors
3. **Check Firebase** to verify data structure
4. **Report any issues** with specific error messages

## ✨ What's Better Now

✅ **Organized**: Messages grouped by conversation
✅ **Reliable**: No more "Unknown" names
✅ **Easy**: One click "Contact" on marketplace
✅ **Instant**: Real-time updates via listeners
✅ **Thoughtful**: Auto-scroll to latest
✅ **Accessible**: Loading states and error messages
✅ **Scalable**: Structure supports growth
