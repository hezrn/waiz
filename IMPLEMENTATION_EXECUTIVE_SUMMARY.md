5. Opens chat with actual seller name (not "Unknown")
6. Send message → appears instantly
7. Conversation saved for future reference
```

### Household User (Seller)
```
1. Receive "New message" notification
2. Open Messages tab

## 💡 Key Improvements

### Before This Implementation
- ❌ User names often showed as "Unknown"
- ❌ Messages in flat collection
- ❌ Contact button didn't create structure
- ❌ No auto-scroll
- ❌ Basic error handling
- ❌ Poor mobile experience

### After This Implementation
- ✅ Real names always displayed
- ✅ Messages organized by conversation
- ✅ Contact button creates formal conversation

## 📈 Technical Highlights

### Architecture
- **Firebase Realtime Database** for real-time sync
- **Firestore Fallback** for user name resolution
- **React Hooks** for state management
- **Real-time Listeners** on conversations and messages

### Data Structure
```javascript
conversations/
├── conv_{sorted_user_pairs}/
│   ├── metadata (participants, names, timestamps)
│   └── messages/
│       └── message objects
```

### Function Highlights
```typescript
// Main entry point for contact button
getOrCreateConversation(userId1, userId2)

// Get real user names
fetchUserNameFromDB(userId)

// Send organized messages
sendConversationMessage(conversationId, ...)

// Get other participant name
getOtherParticipantName(conversationId, currentUserId)
```

## 🧪 How to Verify

### Quick Verification (5 minutes)
1. Open marketplace as Junkshop
2. Click Contact on any item
3. Should see seller's real name (not "Unknown")
4. Send a message
5. Should appear instantly

### Full Verification (15 minutes)
1. Follow quick verification
2. Check Firebase: should have `conversations/` collection
3. Check conversation structure matches docs
4. Test auto-scroll by sending multiple messages
5. Test mobile view (responsive)
6. Check console for no errors (F12)

### Firebase Verification
1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Navigate to Realtime Database
3. Look for `conversations/` collection
4. Should contain active conversations
5. Check message structure
